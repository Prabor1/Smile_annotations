# Smile_annotations

Here I used **Bert** for a sentiment analysis on twitter dataset. Bert is a large-scale transformer-based Language Model that can be finetuned for a variety of tasks. After importing the dataset I found there are some angry, sad, happy post that are collected from twitter comments. I used a pretrained model from Bert. The tqdm is imported from a progress bar.   

Some addition details on this project is added in the image folder, where I also added one pdf which consists of bert mechanism for pretraining and  fine tuning.
